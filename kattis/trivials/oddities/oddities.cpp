Oddities

Some numbers are just, well, odd. For example, the number 3 is odd, because it is not a multiple of two.
Numbers that are a multiple of two are not odd, they are even. More precisely,
if a number n can be expressed as n=2*k for some integer k, then n is even. For example, 6=2*3 is even.

Some people get confused about whether numbers are odd or even. To see a common example,
do an internet search for the query "is zero even or odd?" (Don't search for this now! You have a problem to solve!)

Write a program to help these confused people.

Input
Input begins with an integer 1<=n<=20 on a line by itself, indicating the number of test cases that follow.
Each of the following n lines contain a test case consisting of a single integer âˆ’10<=x<=10.

Output
For each xx, print either 'x is odd' or 'x is even' depending on whether x is odd or even.

Sample Input 1	    Sample Output 1
3                   10 is even
10                  9 is odd
9                   -5 is odd
-5

    cin >> x;
